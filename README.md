## Who am I?
My name is Gerard Prats Gili. I'm a Computer Engineering student at UAB (Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona) with a growing passion for programming ever since I was 12 years old. I picked it up because I wanted to learn how to make games, but eventually I became entranced by the possibilities it opened and wanted to start creating more: websites, algorithms and artificial intelligence are just a few of the topics I've found interest in. I hope to expand my knowledge by participating in projects and meeting more experienced people in the field to grow as a developer.

As of now, due to my studies, my Github page is mostly a place where I can share side projects, ideas or contribute to others' repositories. My current skills consist of **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Python**, **C/C++**, **Java** and other programming languages I've picked up along the years. I consider myself to be quite versatile when it comes to learning new ones fairly quickly. I've also delved into **MySQL** and **server-side development**, although I am still learning more about these.

## What other skills do I have?
While my main passion is programming, I also possess a passion for creative writing and translation. My native languages are Spanish and Catalan, and my English is almost entirely self-taught through daily use until I reached a fluent level. Other than that, I am in the process of learning other languages such as Japanese in order to reach wider audiences.

Whether it is essays about technology or other pieces, I believe these skills could prove to be useful for future projects I have in mind.
